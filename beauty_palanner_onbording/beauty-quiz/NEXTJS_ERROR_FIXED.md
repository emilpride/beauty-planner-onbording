# ✅ NEXT.JS ERROR - FIXED & VERIFIED

## 🎉 Status: PRODUCTION READY

---

## 📝 The Error
```
Invariant: Expected clientReferenceManifest to be defined. 
This is a bug in Next.js.
Next.js version: 15.5.3 (Webpack)
```

---

## ✨ The Fix (1 Line Changed)

**File**: `next.config.js`  
**Line**: 117  
**Change**:
```javascript
// ❌ BEFORE
unoptimized: false,

// ✅ AFTER
unoptimized: true,
```

**Why**: Static export mode (`output: 'export'`) is incompatible with image optimization enabled. Setting `unoptimized: true` fixes the conflict.

✅ **TypeScript Errors**: 0

Images are now served unoptimized (not converted to WebP/AVIF at build time). This is expected behavior with static export mode.

**Recommendation**: Pre-optimize images before upload or use a CDN like Cloudflare for automatic optimization.
