# ⚡ Quick Fix Reference

## Problem
```
Invariant: Expected clientReferenceManifest to be defined. 
This is a bug in Next.js. (Next.js 15.5.3)
```

## Solution
Changed `next.config.js` line 117:
```javascript
// Before ❌
unoptimized: false,

// After ✅
unoptimized: true,
```

**Why**: `output: 'export'` requires `unoptimized: true`
