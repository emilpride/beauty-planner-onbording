## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Build fails | Run `npm run clean && npm run build` |
| Images broken | Pre-optimize images before upload |
| Deployment fails | Check platform-specific docs |
| Performance slow | Use CDN for images or static assets |

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
```bash
# Revert the fix
git checkout next.config.js

# Or if already deployed, rollback your hosting:
# Firebase: firebase hosting:channel:delete <channel>
# Vercel: Go to dashboard and select previous build
```

## Success Criteria
