        <h2>4. Use of the Service</h2>
        <p><strong>4.1 Prohibited Uses:</strong><br>
        You agree not to misuse the services. This includes not attempting to access the app in ways other than through the interface provided. You must not use Beauty Mirror: AI Planner for illegal, harmful, or objectionable activities, including uploading offensive or inappropriate content.</p>
        <p><strong>4.2 Content Rights:</strong><br>
        All content provided in the app, including but not limited to beauty scores, trends, and analytics, is for informational purposes only. Beauty Mirror: AI Planner does not guarantee results and is not responsible for any decisions you make based on the information provided in the app.</p>

        <h2>5. Subscription Services</h2>
        <p><strong>5.1 Subscription Plans:</strong><br>
        Beauty Mirror: AI Planner offers subscription-based access to premium features, such as unlimited beauty analysis, personalized treatment plans, and exclusive content. Subscription pricing and plans are detailed in the app and on our website.</p>
        <p><strong>5.2 Purchases through Third-Party Platforms:</strong><br>
        The Beauty Mirror: AI Planner App is available via the third-party platform operators Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Therefore, when you make a purchase, you may additionally enter into a separate contract with the respective third-party service provider providing your app store, whose terms and conditions may apply. Depending on the respective third-party service provider’s terms and conditions, you may need to exercise your rights of cancellation and revocation with these service providers.</p>
        <p><strong>5.3 Payment:</strong><br>
        Payments for subscriptions are charged on a recurring basis, either monthly or annually, depending on your selected plan. You agree to provide valid payment information and authorize us to charge your payment method on a recurring basis.</p>
        <p><strong>5.4 Auto-Renewal:</strong><br>
        Subscriptions will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless canceled. You can cancel your subscription at any time through the app or by contacting our support team at <a href="mailto:info@beauty-mirror.com">info@beauty-mirror.com</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>5.5 Free Trials:</strong><br>
        Some of our subscriptions include a trial period, where you can experience the application for a specified period at no cost or at a reduced price (“Trial”). Trials will automatically convert into ongoing paid subscriptions at the end of the trial period. To avoid being charged, you must cancel your subscription prior to the expiration of the trial period. Please review all applicable terms carefully before you sign up for Trial. At the end of the trial period, you will be automatically charged unless you cancel before the trial period ends.</p>

        <h2>6. Price and tax changes</h2>
        <p>6.1 Beauty Mirror: AI Planner may from time to time make changes to subscription, including recurring subscription fees and will communicate any price changes to you in advance. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change and, by continuing to use the subscription after the price change takes effect, you will have accepted the new price. If you don’t agree to a price change, you can reject the change by unsubscribing from the applicable subscription prior to the price change going into effect. If we discover an error in the price of items you have purchased, we will contact you. You will have the option of either reconfirming your order at the correct price or canceling it. If we are unable to contact you, your purchase will be automatically cancelled. Tax rates or other fees are based on the rates applicable at the time of your monthly charge. These amounts can change over time with local tax requirements in your country, state, territory, county, or city. Any change in tax rate will be automatically applied based on the account information you provide.</p>

        <h2>7. Cancellation and Refunds</h2>
        <p><strong>7.1 Subscription Cancellation:</strong><br>
        You must cancel your subscription or Trial before it renews to avoid the billing of the fees for the next Subscription period. If you purchase your subscription through app.beauty-mirror.com, you can cancel the renewal of your subscription at any time by contacting us by email at <a href="mailto:info@beauty-mirror.com">info@beauty-mirror.com</a> and specify the email you used to register your account at app.beauty-mirror.com. Cancellation will take effect at the end of your current billing period, and you will continue to have access to premium features until the end of the billing period.</p>
        <p><strong>7.2 Refunds:</strong><br>
        We generally do not provide refunds for subscription payments. However, exceptions may be made at our discretion in cases of system errors or unauthorized transactions. If you believe you are entitled to a refund, please contact our support team for assistance.</p>

        <h2>8. Termination</h2>

        <p><strong>8.2 Termination by User:</strong><br>
        You may terminate your account at any time by contacting support. Termination of your account will not automatically cancel your subscription, so you must cancel any active subscriptions separately.</p>
